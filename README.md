🛠️ How to Use:
Each file is self-contained and can be compiled and run individually using any Java IDE or the command line.
Just clone the repo or download the code, and start exploring!

📌 Purpose:
This repository helps track my progress in mastering Java basics and serves as a reference for future projects and interviews. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
